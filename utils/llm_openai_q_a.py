                - Tweak your prompts to overcome the error

            The dataset is ALREADY loaded into a DataFrame named 'df'. DO NOT load the data again.
            
            The DataFrame has the following columns: {column_names}
            
            Before executing, ensure the data is ready:
            1. Check if columns that are supposed to be numeric are recognized as such. If not, attempt to convert them.
            2. Handle NaN values by filling with mean or median.
            
            Use package Pandas and Matplotlib ONLY. Make sure you import the packages.
            Provide SINGLE CODE BLOCK with a solution using Pandas and Matplotlib plots in a single figure to address the following query:
            
            {input_query}

            - USE SINGLE CODE BLOCK with a solution. 
            - Do NOT EXPLAIN the code 
            - DO NOT COMMENT the code. 
            - ALWAYS WRAP UP THE CODE IN A SINGLE CODE BLOCK.
            - The code block must start and end with ```
            
            - Example code format ```code```
        
            - If the user asks to create plot, Colors to use for background and axes of the figure : #F0F0F6
            - Try to use the following color palette for coloring the plots : #8f63ee #ced5ce #a27bf6 #3d3b41
